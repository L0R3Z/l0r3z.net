                ‚Ä¢ We retrieved a trampoline that one of our neighbour was giving out for free,
                we disassembled it and put reinstalled it in our front yard, we cleaned it and <b>now
                we have a trampoline</b>! <small>(i was thinking about

                    considering the hardware! I'm soooo happy about it, and it's not even fully set up yet
                    <i>(subwoofer incoming)</i>. We're going to have incredible movie nights with my roomates and we even plan
                    to throw parties it would be sooooo fun......
