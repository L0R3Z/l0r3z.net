                    I've been very busy recently: <i>huge travel to Japan, moving back to France, starting a new
                        internship, doing a lot of stuff with my friends...</i> I feel good and satisfied with my life
                    atm,
                    except for the fact that I didn't have time to work on my personal projects, including l0r3z! But
                    with this new page and the music player on <a href="/home/" target="_parent">the homepage</a>,
                    <mark>I can
                        officially say that I'm back at it!</mark>
                </p>
                <p>Funilly enough, <b>I designed this page two month ago in Kyoto</b>, Japan, in an
                    hotel room, and I just finished implementing it just now, in France, in my room lol. I'm quite
                    satisfied with it rn, <small>I just hope I'll be motivated enough to regularly write new entries
                        haha</small>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well that's about it for now, <mark>I hope you like this new page!</mark> I also hope that the music
                    player is
                    working, ping me if anything seems off lol. Speaking of that, if you have
                    any suggestion or stuff you want to talk
                    about... i'll try to add a chatbox or smth, but in the meantime, <b>feel free to reach me on <a
                            href="https://bsky.app/profile/l0r3z.net" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>!</b>
