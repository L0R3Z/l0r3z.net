                    Yo! Yeah yeah i know, still no content update lol... I still wanted to write a bit about last month!
                <h2 style="text-align: right;">Gaming</h2>
                <p>
                    I finished the Half Life serie <small>(except Half Life Alyx)</small> and it was pretty good. I played the whole thing with 
                    my Valve obsessed very cool friend Miamoalex and I think having a true half life nerd in a call while playing the game really
                    enhanced the experience, he had little anecdotes and trivia about the lore etc. It was really fun and it made some of the more
                    tedious parts more enjoyable. I was very surprised by how good the first game was (i played Black Mesa, the fan-made remake,
                    so that's probably why lol, but still). What shocked me was the fact i was able to play 2 to 3 hours of the same game without getting
                    tired of it, which is very rare for me (i'm usually more of a "do something for 1 hour and switch activity" kind of person). When 
                    a game hook me like that i know it's good, and it kept getting better and better until the end of the serie and now before i knew it
                    i was invested in the lore and making theories about the G-man and stuff. Now i get why people love thoses games so much and why
                    they can stop talking about "half life 3" lol. Can't wait to play Alyx.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Keeping up with the gaming, we tried Repo and Peak with two of my dearest friends and god proximity chat games are fun.
                    I cannot recommend them enough, if you have friends, try them out. Repo is like a goofy ah Lethal Company, equally scary and lethal
                    and hard but with some really absurd stuff which makes it even better imo. And Peak is already a pretty fun and engaging game solo
                    (it's about climbing a mountain) so it's even better with friends (still have to beat it tho, we died like 50m from the end....).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also i started Deltarune back from the beginning like yesterday, litteraly cannot wait to get to chapters 3+4, hardly managed to
                    not getting spoiled while going on socials ;-; But that's July's concerns!
                </p>
                <h2 style="text-align: right;">Pride</h2>
                <p>
                    One's cannot understate the fact that it was pride month last month... so of course we went to the pride. I don't feel 
                    LGBTQ+ enough to be part of the community even if i'm definitely queer on several levelss lol, but i'm still an ally all the way
                    down. It's a subject that matters a lot to me since it concerns a lot of my friends, people i care about, people i look up to and
                    admire, etc. So i really wanted to go to the pride, even if i don't really like crowds and stuff lol. We went with friends
                    and it was fun (and tiring lol it was SO HOT outside).

                    alright yeah microblogging era
                </p>
                <p>
                    i didn't even got to play Deltarune yesterday lol i was too tired to do something interactive i just watched Gumball
                    and went to bed
                </p>
                <h2 style="text-align: right;">Cinema</h2>
                There was a japanese animated movie restrospective at the Paris Cinematheque last month (and still ongoing) and i went
                to see a few movies with friends. It was cool and deeefinitely refreshing since i haven't been to the cinema in a while lool.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This one was cool but i was tired honestly and i fell asleep during an
                            important plot point so i spent half of the movie trying to figure out the plot lol. Otherwise it was good but like
                            mid tier good like i appreciated it but i i won't rewatch it or anything. Also I was obsessed with the fact that
                            the main character looked like Gutz from Berserk.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            So this one was WEIRD. But definitely a vibe like i really liked the art and the
                            music and the global atmosphere and aesthetic and the environment etc. but the movie tells things in a very
                            abstract way with almost only metaphors and biblical references. Also i think i was too tired (again) to handle
                            the 5 minutes still shots of static images so i kinda closed my eyes a bit sometimes. Also the end scene is actually inspired
                            by the end scene of Solaris by Tarkovsky!! that's cool
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Surprisingly it's a movie by Katsuhiro Otomo, the guy who made Akira. I say
                            surprisingly because the movie is VERY different from Akira. Firstly we don't have the dark tone of Akira,
                            and we don't have it's mature and well structured plot either. Steamboy is clearly a children's movie but
                            i wasn't really excepting that so i guess i was a bit disappointed lol. The image is good and the animation is
                            amazing (one of the most expensive japanese animated movie ever made) but the story is very naive and has many
                            plot holes and jumps from one point to another very quickly so [spoiler alert] it starts with some kind of mistery or political
                            intrigue about a mysterious invention and then it builds up on that and builds up and builds up again and in the
                            end we spend like 1 hour watching a big steampunk fight with a giant robot tower and we still don't clearly know
                            what the invention is supposed to be lol.
