                    Yo! Yeah yeah i know, still no content update lol... I still wanted to write a bit about last month!

                    I finished the Half Life serie <small>(except Half Life Alyx)</small> and it was pretty good. I played the whole thing with 
                    my Valve obsessed very cool friend Miamoalex and I think having a true half life nerd in a call while playing the game really
                    enhanced the experience, he had little anecdotes and trivia about the lore etc. It was really fun and it made some of the more
                    tedious parts more enjoyable. I was very surprised by how good the first game was (i played Black Mesa, the fan-made remake,
                    so that's probably why lol, but still). What shocked me was the fact i was able to play 2 to 3 hours of the same game without getting
                    tired of it, which is very rare for me (i'm usually more of a "do something for 1 hour and switch activity" kind of person). When 
                    a game hook me like that i know it's good, and it kept getting better and better until the end of the serie and now before i knew it
                    i was invested in the lore and making theories about the G-man and stuff. Now i get why people love thoses games so much and why
                    they can stop talking about "half life 3" lol. Can't wait to play Alyx.

                    Keeping up with the gaming, we tried Repo and Peak with two of my dearest friends and god proximity chat games are fun.
                    I cannot recommend them enough, if you have friends, try them out. Repo is like a goofy ah Lethal Company, equally scary and lethal
                    and hard but with some really absurd stuff which makes it even better imo. And Peak is already a pretty fun and engaging game solo
                    (it's about climbing a mountain) so it's even better with friends (still have to beat it tho, we died like 50m from the end....).

                <p>
                    Also i started Deltarune back from the beginning like yesterday, litteraly cannot wait to get to chapters 3+4, hardly managed to
                    not getting spoiled while going on socials ;-; But that's July's concerns!

                    One's cannot understate the fact that it was pride month last month... so of course we went to the pride. I don't feel 
                    LGBTQ+ enough to be part of the community even if i'm definitely queer on several levelss lol, but i'm still an ally all the way
                    down. It's a subject that matters a lot to me since it concerns a lot of my friends, people i care about, people i look up to and
                    admire, etc. So i really wanted to go to the pride, even if i don't really like crowds and stuff lol. We went with friends
                    and it was fun (and tiring lol it was SO HOT outside).
