                    Good day! Woke up late, went to the uni to study.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Went to the uni to work on a project where <mark class="highlighted">i had to imagine a far
                        future
                        device from 1000 years in
                        the future</mark>. It was quite fun as I had to also make a prototype and it was my first
                    time
                    using a
                    laser cutter lol. It gave me many ideas but I won't be able to complete them before leaving
                    Japan...

                <p>I don't find it appealing to read books on a screen, a computer, a Kindle or anything like that. I
                    prefer having the physical thing, the paper book. The problem is: it is really expensive, way way
                    more than reading PDFs of books on my computer. Furthermore, I could borrow books from a library,
                    but the vast majority of books I'm interested in are philosophy, personal development, and science
                    subjects (cognitive sciences, video games, software development...). So I would like to be able to
                    annotate the book, write, highlight things, etc. But, like I said, books can be extremely expensive.
                    For example, I'm interested in The Pragmatic Programmer, but the book costs more than $40, which is
                    too much for me to scribble down on, even more since I'm still a student without stable money
                    income. So I thought about: what is my main problem with reading books on a screen? Well, firstly, I
                    have some trouble concentrating while I try to read books. I'm interested into reading more
                    recently, but I've been reading close to nothing for the past 10 years or so ; partly because I have
                    trouble concentrating, and reading asks me to be extra-invested in the task I'm doing. And, since
                    I'm finding it less appealing to read on a screen, I have even more trouble to concentrate. More
                    than the touch of paper, or the feeling of having the real physical book, I think my main problem
                    is: concentration. So, because of money, but also because of the way I'd like to read (annotating,
                    keeping quotes, highlighting stuff...), I think reading on my computer should be a lot more
                    convenient and a way better choice for me.</p>
                <p>So I started searching a bit for a cool e-book/PDF reading app. I searched for open-source, Linux
                    compatible reading softwares (even if I‚Äôm on Windows lol, since I‚Äôm seriously thinking about
                    switching to Linux‚Ä¶). I found two possible choices: Librum and Calibre. Librum seemed cool, with a
                    recent and cool looking UI, dictionary integration and a cloud, but too recent and lacking a strong
                    community like Calibre has. Furthermore, Cloud saving is nice but since I‚Äôm also thinking about
                    creating my own server to store movies, books, websites, etc. it‚Äôs not a feature that I look up to.
                    So Calibre it is!</p>
                <p>Well, it looks like it doesn‚Äôt read PDF‚Ä¶ And I don‚Äôt have Adobe Acrobat, so I can‚Äôt annotate and
                    highlight stuff correctly on PDFs. Still, this may not be a problem as most of the book I want to
                    read should be available as E-Book format. And I guess some people already made a plugin to read
                    PDFs in Calibre? Update, no, there‚Äôs not. But there‚Äôs many plugins to convert PDFs to E-Book format
                    (<a>Jaan Tollander de Balsch How to Manage EPUB and PDF Files for E-reader with Calibre</a>)! But
                    idk if I like it. We‚Äôll see if I keep up with Calibre or switch.</p>

                <p>just a normal, calm day lol‚Ä¶ i forgot to put my alarm on so I overslept for two hours</p>
                <p>worked a bit, and then during the evening I spent quite some time reorganizing my YouTube playlists.
                    I came up with a Liked+, Favorite and All time classics trio to rank videos (in addition to Good
                    video essays and I laughed that I still use). Liked+ to put videos that I liked, bc I actually
                    ‚Äúlike‚Äù every video that I watch lol</p>
                <p>that‚Äôs interesting bc I noticed that I really like to optimize various aspects of my life that
                    doesn‚Äôt seemingly need optimization (like watching YouTube videos for example lol)</p>
                <hr>
                <p>and on the same note, I just watched James Lee video about switching to Linux and using alternatives
                    to Adobe, and it made me want to switch to Linux real bad</p>
                <p>i‚Äôve been a windows bro for all my life now, but it does not match with my craving for optimization
                    and customization, for having a tight digital space exactly arranged according to my personal
                    preferences. Linux does. so i‚Äôm seriously considering setting up a double-boot on my PC when I come
                    back to France in March!</p>
                <p>this video also made me want to educate myself on good and/or open-sources alternatives to big bad
                    softwares like the Adobe gang ; i‚Äôve tried to switch from Unity to Godot already (the transition is
                    in motion), but I now want to do the same for everything: my OS, like I already mentioned, but I
                    also want to replace Photoshop and Premiere, and to create a new set of tools for me to use
                    (preferably with strong communities and thus a lot of plugins and customization options ü•∞)</p>
                <p>and more than all of that, I want to say fuck you to big tech companies and use softwares that are
                    open-source, ethical, actually pretty good and made by people for people</p>
                <hr>
                <p>something else completely! i‚Äôm also seriously thinking about reading more, and I had a recent
                    self-rent about reading on screens (I don‚Äôt like it, but I‚Äôm also seriously thinking about getting
                    used to it and doing it more)</p>
                <p>‚ÄúI don't find it appealing to read books on a screen, a computer, a Kindle or anything like that. I

                <p>A friend from Tokyo came to Hakodate! He‚Äôs from the same school as me in France, but he is doing his
                    exchange program in Rikky≈ç University.</p>
                <p>We spent a few days in Hakodate. We visited the Red Brick Warehouses on Christmas day, and then
                    watched the 25th December firework of the Hakodate Winter Fantasies! We also visited Motomachi: we
                    visited the Museum of Northern Peoples, the Former British Consulate and the Old Public Hall. We
                    went to the Gory≈çkaku park and tower.</p>
                <p>After that, we took a bus to go to Sapporo. We stayed 5 days in a small shared-house. We did a lot a
                    touristic activities during our stay: we visited the big Susukino entertainment district, we ate
                    ramen in the Ramen Yokocho, the Old Clock Tower, the Shiroi Koibito Park‚Ä¶ We spent the New Year‚Äôs
                    Eve counter at the foot of the Sapporo TV Tower. It was very animated and full of tourists! We also
                    wanted to go to the Sapporo Beer Museum but it was closed for New Year‚Ä¶ Overall, it was a very
                    enjoyable trip: we visited a lot of interesting places and we ate at a lot of delicious restaurants.
                </p>
                <p>Also, I didn‚Äôt mention it before, but my friend introduced me to Japanese Eki-Stamps. I bought a
                    stamp book and we had fun collecting several stamps from every places we visited! It was a good way
                    to make the trip even more fun!</p>
                <p>I didn‚Äôt see the snow sculpture since the festival is in February, but I am coming back to Sapporo
                    with AD and other friends in the beginning of February during the festival!</p>
