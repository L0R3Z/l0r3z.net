            <p>it was a good day</p>
            <p>i spent a pretty fun morning</p>
            <p>i was very tired and sleepy but it was alright</p>
            <p>but i had a big crisis tonight</p>
            <p>because of me, of my head, of how i handle my feelings, how i handle relations</p>
            <p>it's so hard for me to rationalize</p>
            <p>my head is fucked up and i'm just feeling sad</p>
            <p>so so sad and i won't even cry</p>
            <p>and i'm probably just sad about meaningless things!</p>
            <p>and even if they mean something, i shouldn't care that much</p>
            <p>i should just be happy and get on with my life</p>
            <p>that's so hard omg</p>
            <p>to feel alright</p>
            <p>bro ima just go watch shit on youtube to clear my mind</p>
            <p>see ya</p>

            <p>today, i'm feeling down</p>
            <p>it was a good day tho, some fun stuff happened at school</p>
            <p>but idk, i don't feel good, i feel emotionnaly unstable</p>
            <p>things added up during the day: nearly no lunch break, horrible courses, the feeling of being left out by friends, and finally the loss of a course project that I spent an hour on</p>
            <p>so i went home, i did things that i had to do, and then i cryied lying on my desk listening to Porter Robinson</p>
            <p>i'll feel better tomorrow</p>
            <p>for now i'm going to call on discord with a friend to sheer me up</p>
            <p>see ya</p>
