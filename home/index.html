Expect a lot of "are you a boy or are you a girl?" from confused onlookers. Enjoy being yourself.</div>

                    <h2>WEBSITE'S CODE OF HONOR</h2>
                    <p id="codeofhonor--description"><strong class="lightbold">the core principles that i want to follow while making this website.</strong> those are really important to me, here or in my personal life :)</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>1. make value out of everyday life.</strong></p>
                            <p>this is actually the main purpose of this website. to stop saying "my life is boring" and start realizing that it's not at all!</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>2. do something.</strong><br>i've spent so many days doing nothing, "just chilling" but feeling awful about it at the same time, despite the fact that i have so many interests and passions and i love to create! so let's do something instead</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>3. consume less, create more.</strong><br>i have a lot of interests, and thus i consume a lot of media. i want to give myself more time to reflect on the things i consume, instead of drowning them in an ocean of content. if i truly enjoy something, i want to create something out of it!</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>4. the process is more important than the result.</strong><br>i've been drown to use AI more and more for my academic work as i study in this field, and it overlapped on my personal projects. i realized that i didn't like it at all! the thing is: i don't care about the final product, what i like is creating, so there's no point in using AI to negate the thing that i like doing! still, i'll use AI every now and then, but as a search engine, as a tool to learn, and not as something to replace my creativity.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>5. be the one who inspires.</strong><br>i've been mind-blown and inspired by so many people and things in my life. this includes some personal websites. this time, i want to be the one who inspire others! thus, everything i'll make here will be open source. so you're free to take inspiration or take bits of code from my website if you need. as long as you don't copy the whole thing <small>(and link to my website somewhere on your website... if you want...)</p>
                        </li>
