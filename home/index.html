                    <h2>WEBSITE CODE OF HONOR</h2>
                    <p>the core principles that i want to follow while making this website. those are really important to me, here or in my personal life</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>1. make value out of everyday life.<br>this is actually the main purpose of this website. to stop saying "my life is boring" and start realizing that it's not at all!</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>2. do something. <br>i've spent so many days doing nothing, "just chilling" but feeling awful about it at the same time, despite the fact that i have so many interests and passions and i love to create! so let's do something instead</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>3. consume less, create more.<br>i have a lot of interests, and thus i consume a lot of media. i want to give myself more time to reflect on the things i consume, instead of drowning them in an ocean of content. if i truly enjoyed something, i want to create something out of it!</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>4. be the one who inspire.<br>i've been mindblown and inspired by so many people and things in my life. this includes some personal websites. this time, i want to be the one who inspire others!</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>5. the process is more important than the result.<br>i've been drown to use AI more and more for my academic work, and it overlapped on my personal projects. i realized that i didn't like it! the thing is: i don't care about the final product, what i like is creating, so there's no point in using AI to negate the thing that i like doing! still, i'll use AI every now and then, but as a search engine, as a tool to learn, or like if i was searching on stackoveflow, and not as something to replace my creativity.</p>
